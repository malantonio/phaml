# Phaml
**Very** WIP [haml][haml_home] parser for PHP. I should have realised that [the name had already been taken][og_phaml], but as a) that project's been seemingly abandoned for over five years (there's a promised "new version" slated for Q4 of 2009) and b) I'm not sure I'll even finish this, I'm not too concerned.
